### Description

I was asked to write a Help file for CozIcon(my icon editor) but I wanted to include it on my website (http://cozicon.onlies.net/). I aslo didn't want to write the whole thing out in notepad so this is what I came up with. HTML Help Maker will allow you to build a custom Table of Contents and edit an html string corresponding to each selection. You can add a html template that will be generated with the html code from what you entered. Try it out.
